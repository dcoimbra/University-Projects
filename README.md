# dhondt

Python script for applying the Dhondt method given a set of electoral circles, parties, and election results. 


Implemented for the Portuguese electoral system.


Made for a Foundations of Programming course and remade years later using NumPy.
Check out the original project description (in Portuguese) for more information and usage details.

I attempted to create a frontend for it in Django but I'm really bad at it. Might get back to it in the future
