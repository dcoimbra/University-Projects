# hashtag_manager

Simple implementation of a hashtag management system. Written in C for an Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures class. Rewritten in C++ years later. Tested on Unix-like systems only.

See the [project description (in Portuguese)](https://github.com/dcoimbra/hashtag-manager/blob/master/iaed_2016_16-2s-p2.pdf) for details and usage instructions.

Supports the following operations:

* Adding the hashtags in a given message

* Finding the total number of hashtags and all occurences of all hashtags

* Finding the most popular hashtag

* Listing all ocurrences of all hashtags.

## Getting Started

The original project targets Unix-like operating systems only, and has been tested in such an environment.
It might work in other systems, but they are out of scope for the course this project was developed for.

### Prerequisites

You only need a compatible C or C++ compiler for their respective versions. This project was tested in GCC.

### Building

C++ version: `make`

And run it with `./proj2`
