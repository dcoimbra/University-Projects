# pycross

Play Pycross with Python!

Originally developed for a Foundations to Programming class. This is my attempt at rewriting it using an object-oriented approach.

Maybe I'll even try to implement a frontend for it using Django.

See the original project description (in Portuguese) for more information and usage details.

Built with Python 3.
