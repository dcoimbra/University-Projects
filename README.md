# pycross

Play Picross with Python! **Not complete. Check TODO.**

Originally developed for a Foundations to Programming class. This is my attempt at rewriting it using an object-oriented approach.

Maybe I'll even try to implement a frontend for it using Django.

See the original [project description (in Portuguese)](https://github.com/dcoimbra/pycross/blob/master/proj2.pdf) for more information and usage details.

Built with Python 3.

## TODO
* Figure out how to properly print a picross table
* Write checker to see if a table is complete
* Write function to actually play the game
